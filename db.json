            "correctChoice": 0,
            "explanation": "Sorry you were wrong, the correct answer is A. ArrayList values = new ArrayList<Integer>(). ArrayLists cannot be composed of primitive data types, and since int is a primative type, you must use the wrapper class version of int, Integer. Also, ArrayList is a class, which is why is must include parenthases at the end."
